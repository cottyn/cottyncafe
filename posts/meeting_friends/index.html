    <p>Meeting new people is rough sometimes, especially for a chronically online introvert shut-in like myself. On the internet, there’s so many different people from differing cultures, backgrounds, everything, so sometimes it feels like you can never really know who you’re talking to unless you meet them face to face, and that alone is a huge coin flip. They could be exactly who you thought they were, and they act the same way they do in person as they did on the internet, or they can be a psychopathic freak who collects pill bug corpses and shit.</p>
<p>There are many people you can meet online, some good and some bad. You can meet friends who will be there for years or people who will stick around for a few days max, and I’ve met many from both sides. It&rsquo;s mainly from video games since social media is honestly borderline terrifying, but I’m sure there are cool people there, too. Just not cool people I’ll end up following any time soon, Twitter users are too scary, their stupidity is unmatched and I fear their power.</p>
<p>Being scared of meeting new people isn’t uncommon. Humans are scary. We do weird shit and only think about ourselves sometimes, but thankfully, that’s not everyone. If you struggle with social anxiety and suck at meeting people, that’s fine. Take things at your own pace until you feel like you’re comfortable enough to get out of your comfort zone. There’s 8.2 billion people on Earth, it&rsquo;s not like they’re going anywhere any time soon.</p>
<p>As jejune as that sounds.</p>
<p>It can take a while to find someone who shares the same interests, especially if the stuff you’re into is niche, but there will always be someone out there who will have similar interests, and realistically it’s just a matter of time until you run into them.</p>
