  <main>
    <p>Good now, Merry Christmas, and happy new year! I know it&rsquo;s been a while; that&rsquo;s on me. I&rsquo;m a little bit of a dumbass and forgot I had a site for a good month or so.</p>
<p>Anyway, hi again. I want to talk about something that&rsquo;s been making it a little harder to post as of late: terrible time management and me picking up several things at once.</p>
<p>I have a very active imagination. Lots of shit I want to do, and even more ideas every day, and I even write a large majority of them down in a notebook I keep to myself. But I don&rsquo;t always have the energy, money, or time to actually do much with all of those ideas, and when I do go through with them, I fail to manage my time well. So here I&rsquo;m going to talk about a few of the small projects I&rsquo;ve started and things I&rsquo;ve picked up.</p>
<h1 id="dreams-of-abyss">Dreams of Abyss</h1>
<p>For the longest time, I always wanted to make a game that could connect with people; Dreams of Abyss is my attempt at that game. I want to make something that can cover the struggles of real life while still being an escape, if that&rsquo;s what people need.</p>
<p>A top-down RPG, taking inspiration from games such as Disco Elysium, Undertale (god rest your soul, you were great until the community formed), Mother, and a few others.</p>
<p>A large reason I haven&rsquo;t been posting at all is because I&rsquo;ve actually been busy working on this game with a close friend of mine, as well as my roommate, who will likely be handling the things I&rsquo;m too stupid to make, such as music and probably some sprites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll likely expand more on DoA in the future in a separate post, since it&rsquo;s something actively being worked on. Maybe I&rsquo;ll dedicate a few posts to keeping whoever reads this updated and such, so I guess look out for those if I don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<h1 id="3d-art">3D Art</h1>
<p>I make 3D art. I have been for several years. 5,300 hours in Blender and 5,100 in Source Filmmaker. It&rsquo;s been something I&rsquo;ve been passionate about for years, and it&rsquo;s genuinely something I love doing, as well as something I love sharing with the people who are interested.</p>
<p>A great friend of mine suggests I start taking commissions, which, personally, I&rsquo;d love to do, because I&rsquo;m a greedy piece of shit who loves cash. But I feel like I could use a lot more practice before charging people for anything I can make. And as a perfectionist, I always feel like something can be better, which leads to constant revisions and unnecessary changes, and it makes the end result look worse. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to work on in the near future.</p>
<p>Mostly for the money. I want to be able to get cool shit for my friends and be able to comfortably fund future projects I might want to invest in.</p>
<h1 id="this-site">This Site</h1>
<p>I love this site. I love having a blog, even if I don&rsquo;t post on it very often (I&rsquo;ll start posting more, promise). It&rsquo;s a great way to ramble about shit I like. I get to type out a bunch of random shit and force my friends to read it, which is always pretty nice.</p>
<p>Setting this thing up was a fucking hassle, I&rsquo;ll tell you that much. And learning how to use it properly was also rough, but that&rsquo;s more so because of my unrivaled incompetence. For like a week, there was still placeholder text in the art tab; I only noticed because my best friend pointed it out, since she&rsquo;s the person who kind of put a majority of this stuff together.</p>
<hr>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot I&rsquo;ve been working on, and a lot more I&rsquo;d love to keep working on, and this time I mean it when I say I&rsquo;ll try to keep people updated with it, even if there&rsquo;s not really anyone who&rsquo;ll read a good chunk of it. And if that is the case, I can at least use it as a good archive, so I&rsquo;ll take that over nothing.</p>
<p>Cool thanks for reading get out.</p>
